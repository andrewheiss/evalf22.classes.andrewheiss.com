.box-6.medium[Why does the cutoff need<br>to be unique to the<br>program of interest?]

???

In theory, to take care of confounding. If the same cutoff is used for two different programs, and you're evaluating one, and the other isn't automatic, peoples' use of the second program would influence their outcomes in the first one.
