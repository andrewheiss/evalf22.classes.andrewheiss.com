# Does paying people cause people to get vaccinated against COVID-19?

An RCT in Sweden found that giving people 200 Swedish kroner (≈$24 USD) increased vaccination rates by 4.2 percentage points. ([See here](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abm0475) for full details.) 

We're going to re-analyze their data.


## Load and clean data

```{r libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(haven)  # For reading Stata files

vaccines_raw <- read_stata("data/vaccines.dta")
```

```{r}
print_labels(vaccines_raw$treatment)
```

```{r}
# Clean up treatment variable and check treatment assignment
```


```{r}
# group_by + summarize to see averages of vaccinated and intention1
```


```{r}
# Basic model with lm
```


```{r}
# Cleaner data
# vaccines_clean <- vaccines_raw %>% 
#   mutate(across(c(female, age_band, region, covid1_2, civilstatus, 
#                   haschildren, education, occupation, 
#                   mother, father, income),
#                 factor)) %>% 
#   filter(already_vacced == 0, !is.na(intention1))
```

## Nicer way with `feols()`
