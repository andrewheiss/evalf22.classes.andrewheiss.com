title: "Code examples"
---

Visit this section after you have finished the readings and lecture videos. It contains fully annotated R code and other supplementary information and it will be indispensable as you work on your problem sets and project.

Many sections also contain videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. You'll notice me make all sorts of little errors, which *is totally normal*—everyone does!
